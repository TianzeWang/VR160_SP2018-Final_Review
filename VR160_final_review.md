* 10 MC, 3 short explanations, 2 explanation (C+D(mathematics))

### Part I
* High politics and Low politics:
    - High: Military and Security
    - Low: Economic, Social and Environmental
* States vs. Nations
    - States: Five factors
        + Legal rights, Solve Jurisdiction, Unrestricted control over domestic, Freedom in Foreign Relation,
        + sovereignty: the exclusive rights of states to make, enforce, and adjudicate laws within their own domains
    - Nations: De facto Concept
        + Tibet, Xinjiang
* Perceptions: How perceptions get affected.
    - Heuristic: judgemental shortcut, limited information
        + *For instance, most people are attentive to things that confirm their preconceived beliefs, they are prone to rely on readily available data, and they give disproportionate weight to the first information they receive*
    - Schematic Reasoning: Compared with generic concepts
    - Attribution Bias: 双标狗，自己做事的时候是事出有因(situational factor)，别人做事就是品德差(dispositional factor)
    - Cognitive dissonance(认知和实际不符): Deny or rationalize discrepancies(differences) between preexisting belief with new information
* mirror image
    - the tendency of people in competitive interaction to perceive each other similarly—to see an adversary the same way as an adversary sees them. 
    - Virtue in their own, malice in their adversaries
* Levels and analysis
    - Individual: psychological factors motivating people who make foreign policy
    - State: how the internal attributes of states influence their foreign policy behavior
    - Systematic: the impact of international structures and processes on the behavior of global actors
    - Remote & Proximate
    - Here is a table showing the relations with detailed explanation

| | Remote | Proximate|
|---|---|-----|
|Individual|Leaders as moral exemplars “The pope started this chain of events that led to the end of communism.”| <ul><li> Leaders as movers of history “Ronald Reagan won the Cold War by being tough on the communists.”</li><li>  “[The end of the Cold War was possible] primarily because of one man—Mikhail Gorbachev. The transformations we are dealing with now would not have begun were it not for him.”</li>|
|State| **State Attribute**: <ul><li>*Political Inertia* “Given communism’s inherent unworkability … the Soviet empire was doomed in the long run.” </li> <li> Economic mismanagement “No other industrialized state [than the Soviet Union] in the world for so long spent so much of its national wealth on armaments and military forces. Soviet militarism, in harness with communism, destroyed the Soviet economy and thus hastened the self-destruction of the Soviet empire.” </li></ul>|Media attention “It was the moral reassessment of the seventy-odd years of this socialist experiment that shook the nation.… It was the flood of publications of the Soviet Union’s human rights record and its tremendous distortions of moral and ethical principles that discredited the system, especially when introduced into the everyday lives of its individual citizens through the popular media.”|
|Systematic| Containment “The U.S. and our allies deserve great credit for maintaining the military and economic power to resist and turn back the Soviet aggression.”|“The acute phase of the fall of communism started outside of the Soviet Union and spread to the Soviet Union itself. By 1987, Gorbachev made it clear that he would not interfere with internal experiments in Soviet bloc countries.… Once communism fell in Eastern Europe, the alternative in the Soviet Union became civil war or dissolution.”|

    - Liberalism: a belief in reason and the possibility of progress
        + Human being matters
        + **Ordered Anarchy**: Non-government
